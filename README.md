# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this week's challenge I went through different CSV files and Sqlite file to analyize it

The Assignment was consistent of two parts.

Analyze and Explore the Climate Data:
    In this section I created and worked on an ipnb file. I analyize the climate csv files and worked on some graphs as well.

Design your Climate App:
    In this section I designed a Flask API based on the queries that I developed in the previous section.

Connectivity with GitHub:
    My respository is connected to my local repository through GitHub App on my computer. Once I made the repository on GitHub I simply connected it to my local repository through my GitHub desktop App on my computer. As I worked on the Challege I would push the changes through the Desktop GitHub App.

Help: I got help from the class notes. I also searched YouTube and Google. I would say most of the help came from the lectures and activities and then some from YouTube and Google.
    I also colloborated with two of my classmates; Anthony and Priyanka.
